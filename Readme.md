# Milestone Assignments by PW Skills

## Introduction
This repository contains the Milestone assignments given by PW Skills. In these assignments, we were tasked to create three projects using different technologies.

## Projects

### 1. Blog Webapp using HTML, CSS, and JS
For the first project, we had to create a Blog Web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The objective was to build an interactive blog platform.

To work on this project, you can clone the repository to your local system using the following command:
git clone https://github.com/Rishabh6306/MileStone-Repo.git


Inside the `Project-1` folder, you'll find the following files:
- `index.html`
- `style.css`
- `script.js`

### 2. Movie Search App using HTML, CSS, and JS
The second project involved building a Movie Search application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This app allows users to search for their favorite movies and get relevant results.

To check this project, you can run it directly from the live server. Inside the `Project-2` folder, you'll find the following files:
- `index.html`
- `style.css`
- `script.js`

### 3. Todo Webapp using React JS
In the third project, we had to develop a Todo Web application using React JS.

To run this project, you need to have `npm` installed on your system. After cloning the repository, navigate to the `Project-3` folder and run the following command to install the dependencies:
npm install


The folder structure for this project follows the npm Vite app structure. Inside the `src` folder, you'll find a `components` folder containing the following files:
- `Remove.jsx`
- `TodoInput.jsx`
